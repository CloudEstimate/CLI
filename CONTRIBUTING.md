# Contributing to CloudEstimate

Hi! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m **Regnard Raquedan**, and Iâ€™m thrilled that youâ€™re interested in contributing to **CloudEstimate**. This project is open source, and we encourage contributions from the community. Whether you want to improve existing software configs or add new ones, your help is greatly appreciated!

## How to Contribute

### 1. Fork the Repository

-   First, fork this repository to your own GitHub account and clone the project to your local machine.

    `git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/CLI.git` 

### 2. Work on Software Configs

We're specifically looking for contributions to the software YAML configuration files for different self-managed/hosted applications. Each softwareâ€™s resource usage (vCPU, memory, storage) should reflect real-world deployment scenarios across cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure).

#### Steps:

-   Navigate to the `config/software/` directory.
-   Create or modify YAML files for software you'd like to contribute to.
-   Make sure to define **fixed** and **variable** resource components as seen in the existing configurations (e.g., `gitlab.yaml`, `ubuntu.yaml`).

### 3. Submit a Pull Request

Once you're satisfied with your changes, submit a pull request (PR) to the **main** branch. Weâ€™ll review it as soon as possible!
